The vampire community is similar in some ways to Goth, but with a considerable amount of differences from it. And that doesnâ€™t go into the difference between classical vampires and clinical vampires, in which I primarily work with as a writer.

I believe that the genre should move in a more realistic direction, with a focus primarily on vampire as a genetic disorder, similar to sanguephilia. In many ways Vampire is closer to a fetish than a supernatural creature of the night.

Therefore I will be focusing my efforts on fleshing out vampire as a genetic disorder within my body of work. In some cases, it is derived as a genetic mutation from Nuclear Fallout. In this case, the only similarity to cultural vampire is nominal at best. We can also be viewed as a kind of cultural group, that likes a darker science fiction aesthetic, disconnected from other dark science fiction like Cyberpunk.

The music shall be more reminiscent of Quebec folk music with J-Pop, with synthesia and vocaloid additions. Our sequential art medium is Os Besonasigos, and our language Fraponic.

Savor the blood of humans.

Be a clinical vampire.
